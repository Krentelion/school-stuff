        <p>Not much is interesting about me, but I'm forced to make a webpage. Not to stroke my ego, but I'd say I'm extremely good at making websites.</p><br>
        <p>I like:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li id="favorite">Biking*</li>
            <li>Volleyball</li>
            <li>Gaming</li>
            <li>Going out</li>
            <li>Procrasinating</li>
        </ol>
        <p id="small">* Only like it when I'm not forced to go out. Nighttime is the best, honestly.</p>
